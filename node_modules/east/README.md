# east

east - node.js database migration tool for different databases (extensible via
[adapters](#adapters)).

east connects to the db using particular adapter (mongodb, sqlite, postgres,
mysql, couchbase), keeps track of executed migrations by storing their names
inside db and makes connect to the db available inside `migrate` and `rollback`
functions. east encourages you to use for migrations driver/syntax with which
you are already familiar with (apparently you use it for work with db at your
application) and doesn't provide universal api for working with any kind of
database.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/okv/east.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/okv/east)

## Node.js compatibility

east itself requires node.js >= 0.10 to work.

Please note that particular adapter may have another requirements (see
documentation for specific adapter).

## Installation

```sh
npm install east -g
```

alternatively you could install it locally

## Usage

go to project dir and run

```sh
east init
```

after that you can `create`, `migrate`, `rollback` your migrations.

Run `east -h` to see all commands:

```sh

  Usage: east [options] [command]

  Commands:

    init                   initialize migration system
    create <basename>      create new migration based on template
    migrate [options]      run all or selected migrations
    rollback [options]     rollback all or selected migrations
    list [status]          list migration with selected status (`new`, `executed` or `all`), `new` by default
    *

  Options:

    -h, --help           output usage information
    -V, --version        output the version number
    --adapter <name>     which db adapter to use
    --config <path>      config file to use
    --timeout <timeout>  timeout for migrate/rollback
    --template <path>    path to template for new migrations
    --dir <dir>          dir where migrations stored
    --url <url>          db connect url
    --trace              verbose mode (including error stack trace)

```

run `east <command> -h` to see detail command help.

All options described above can be set via command line or at `.eastrc` file
located at current directory, e.g.:

```js

{
	"dir": "./dbmigration",
	"template": "./lib/node/utils/customMigrationTemplate.js"
}

```

`.eastrc` also can be a regular nodejs script (instead of json file):

```js

var path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    dir: path.join(__dirname, 'dbmigration'),
    template: './lib/node/utils/customMigrationTemplate.js'
};

```

### create

```sh
east create doSomething
```

produces something like this

```sh
New migration `1_doSomething` created at migrations/1_doSomething.js
```

created file will contain

```js
exports.migrate = function(client, done) {
    done();
};

exports.rollback = function(client, done) {
    done();
};
```

`client` is connect to current db and he determined by adapter (see [adapters](#adapters) section)
`done` is function which should be called at the end of migration (if any
error occured you can pass it as first argument)
migration also can be synchronous - declare only `client` at `migrate` or `rollback`
`rollback` function is optional and may be omitted

Migration file is normal node.js module and you can migrate any database e.g.

```js
// include your database wrapper which you already use in app
var db = require('./db');

exports.migrate = function(client, done) {
    db.connect(function(err) {
        if (err) done(err);
        db.things.insert({_id: 1, name: 'apple', color: 'red'}, done);
    });
};

exports.rollback = function(client, done) {
    db.connect(function(err) {
        if (err) done(err);
        db.things.remove({_id: 1}, done);
    });
};

```

or you can use special adapter for database (see [adapters](#adapters) section)

### migrate

let's create one more migration

```sh
east create doSomethingElse
```

then executes both of them

```sh
east migrate
```

it sequentially executes all new migrations and produces

```sh
target migrations:
    1_doSomething
    2_doSomethingElse
migrate `1_doSomething`
migration done
migrate `2_doSomethingElse`
migration done
```

selected migrations can be executed by passing their names (or numbers or
basenames or paths) as argument

```sh
east migrate 1_doSomething 2
```

in our case this command will skip all of them

```sh
skip `1_doSomething` because it`s already executed
skip `2_doSomethingElse` because it`s already executed
nothing to migrate
```

you can pass `--force` option to execute already executed migrations.
This is useful while you develop and test your migration.

You also can export `tags` array from migration and then migrate only
migrations that satisfied expression specified by option `--tag`. Expression
consists of tag names and boolean operators `&`, `|` and `!`. For example,
following command will migrate all migrations that have tag `tag1` and not have
tag `tag2`:

```sh
east migrate --tag 'tag1 & !tag2'
```

### rollback

`rollback` has similar to `migrate` command syntax but executes `rollback`
function from migration file

```sh
east rollback
```

will produce

```sh
target migrations:
    2_doSomethingElse
    1_doSomething
rollback `2_doSomethingElse`
migration successfully rolled back
rollback `1_doSomething`
migration successfully rolled back
```

### list

```sh
east list
```

shows new migrations e.g.

```sh
new migrations:
     1_doSomething
     2_doSomethingElse
```

target status could be specified as an argument e.g.

```sh
east list executed
```


## Adapters

adapter determines where executed migration names will be stored and what will be
passed to `migrate` and `rollback` function as `client`.
Default adapter store executed migration names at file `.migrations` which is
located at migrations directory and pass `null` as `client`.

Other adapters:
* [mongodb](https://github.com/okv/east-mongo)
* [sqlite](https://github.com/2do2go/east-sqlite)
* [postgres](https://github.com/2do2go/east-postgres)
* [mysql](https://github.com/riggerthegeek/east-mysql)
* [couchbase](https://github.com/ramiel/east-couchbase)


## Run tests

into cloned repository run

```sh
npm test
```

## Creating and testing own adapter

For writing your own adapter you should implement methods for connection,
mark transaction as executed, etc see details inside [built-in adapter](lib/adapter.js)
and [other adapters](#adapters).

You also can run tests from current repository against your adapter:

* Clone current repository
* Create file `.eastrc` inside `test` directory with path and parameters for
your adapter e.g.

```js
{
    "adapter": "../../east-mysql/lib/adapter",
    "url": "mysql://user:password@localhost/east_test_db",
    "createDbOnConnect": true
}
```

* Run `npm test` at root of the cloned repository.
